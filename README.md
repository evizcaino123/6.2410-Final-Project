# Digital Twin for Classical Shadow Tomography

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a digital twin for simulating classical shadow tomography on quantum systems. The project focuses on incorporating realistic features such as lossy channels, noisy state generation, and faulty gates into the simulation to mirror the actual behavior observed in quantum devices like the qutool's quED. This digital twin aims to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental validations, enhancing the reliability of simulations in quantum computing.

## Data:
The data included in the 6.2410_Jacob_Esteban_TOMOGRAPHY (1).ipynb, is not the eact same set of data used for the calcuations within the paper, this was a rerun, under slightly diffrent conditions.
